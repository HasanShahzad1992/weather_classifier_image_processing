# Weather Image Classification

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify weather conditions based on images. The model is trained on a large dataset containing images representing various weather conditions such as rain, sunshine, sandstorm, snow, etc. Once trained, the model can predict the weather condition of a given image.

## Overview

Understanding weather conditions is essential for various applications, including forecasting, climate analysis, and disaster management. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying weather conditions based on images, providing a valuable tool for weather analysis and prediction.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Gathered a large dataset of weather images representing different weather conditions, including rain, sunshine, sandstorm, snow, etc.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocessed the collected images, converting them into NumPy arrays, and encoding the corresponding labels using one-hot encoding.

- **Model Training:** Divided the data into input features (X) and target labels (Y), then trained a machine learning model using the TensorFlow framework.

- **Prediction:** Utilized the trained model to predict the weather condition of new images, providing insights into real-time weather conditions
